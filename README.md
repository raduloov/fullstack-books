## About

Fullstack Books is my first attempt at building a fullstack MERN application. An online book library where you can browse books with the help of the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/), create an account and save them to "Favorites" and "To Read" lists. The front-end is written in TypeScript and the server in JavaScript.

## Tech Stack

#### Front-end

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- TailwindCSS

#### Back-end Server

- Node.js
- Express
- Mongoose / MongoDB
- JWT Authentication

- GraphQL

<!-- ## Key Features -->

## Usage

The app is not deployed as of now, if you would like to try it for yourself or contribute, follow these steps:

- Clone or download this repo
- Run `yarn install` in the root of the project
- Run `yarn start` to start the React front-end
- Run `yarn server` to start the server (it is set to run on port 8080 by default)
