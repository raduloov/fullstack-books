## About

Fullstack Books is my first attempt at building a fullstack MERN application. An online book library where you can browse books with the help of the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/), create an account and save them to "Favorites" and "To Read" lists. The front-end is written in TypeScript and the server in JavaScript.

## Tech Stack

#### Front-end

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- TailwindCSS

#### Back-end Server

- Node.js
- Express
- Mongoose / MongoDB
- JWT Authentication

- GraphQL

## Live Demo

### [Fullstack Books Live Demo](https://fullstack-books.vercel.app)

## Usage

This repository is split up into two projects - the frontend (client) and the backend (server).

You can check out the [live demo](https://fullstack-books.vercel.app) or if you would like to play with the code or contribute, follow these steps:

- Clone or download this repo
- Run `cd client && yarn install && cd .. && cd server && yarn install & cd ..` to install the packages
- Run `yarn start` in `client` to start the React front-end
- Run `yarn start` in `server` to start the server (it is set to run on port 8080 by default)
